```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Load in common libraries used by this package
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

```
Now we install my R Package
```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("awatt008/R_Package_Wattler")
library(projects)
```

Let us download some data for our package:
```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awatt008/R_Package_Wattler/master/Data/surveys.csv", destfile = "data/surveys.csv")
```
Now, we load the data
```{r eval = FALSE}
surveys <- read_csv("data/surveys.csv")
```
##Working Example

+ an example of each function and how it works
+ say something about why this is a good thing to do
+ say something about expected output

```{r}
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
